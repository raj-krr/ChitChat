# ChitChat 💬

ChitChat is a real-time chat application built with a modern full-stack architecture,
focused on performance, scalability, and clean separation of concerns.

The project is designed to simulate a production-grade messaging platform,
including authentication, real-time communication, and structured frontend/backend workflows.

---

## ✨ Why ChitChat?

Most chat applications hide complexity behind simple UI.
ChitChat is built to **embrace that complexity**—handling real-time messaging,
state synchronization, pagination, and socket-driven updates in a clean and maintainable way.

This project prioritizes:
- Real-world architecture
- Clean code separation
- Scalable real-time communication
- Industry-aligned development practices

---

## 🚀 Core Capabilities

- Secure user authentication
- One-to-one real-time messaging
- Socket-based message delivery
- Optimistic UI updates
- Message pagination & scroll preservation
- Reply-to message support
- Modular frontend and backend separation
- Extensible architecture for future AI integration

---

## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

ChitChat follows a client-server architecture with a dedicated real-time layer:

- **Frontend**: Manages UI, state, socket listeners, and user interactions
- **Backend**: Handles authentication, APIs, message persistence, and socket events
- **Realtime Layer**: Socket.io enables instant bi-directional communication
- **Database**: MongoDB stores users, chats, and messages

## ⚙️ Getting Started

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/raj-krr/chitchat.git

# Start backend
cd backend
npm install
npm run dev

# Start frontend
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```
## 🔒 Authentication Flow (High Level)

1. User registers or logs in  
2. Backend issues a JWT  
3. Token is stored on the client  
4. Authenticated API requests and socket connections use the token  

---

## 🌐 Realtime Messaging Flow

1. User sends a message  
2. Frontend updates the UI optimistically  
3. Message is emitted through a socket event  
4. Backend validates and persists the message  
5. Receiver is notified instantly via socket
